# OPINION

The present generation relies heavily on data and their labellings. Building well trained models requires plenty of labelled data. Opinion is an effort to build a platform where people can use the platform to label to their dataset.

The platform can be used for both personal and professional use. The user can build spaces both private and public. The owner of the space can post conversations within a space that are received by its members. The members are given a choice to either like[1] or dislike[0] (binary classification).
