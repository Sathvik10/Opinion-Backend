# OPINION

The present generation relies heavily on data and its labels. Building well-trained models requires plenty of labeled data. Opinion is an effort to build a platform where people can use the platform to label their dataset.

The platform can be used for both personal and professional purposes. The user can build spaces that are both private and public. The owner of the space can post conversations within the space that are received by its members. The members are given a choice to either like [1] or dislike [0] (binary classification).

1. Frontend : [React Native App] (Yet to start)
2. Backend : [Java, Spring Boot] (Planning to integrate GraphQL for better API performance)
3. Database : [NoSql, MongoDB]
